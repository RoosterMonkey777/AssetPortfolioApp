#  My Portfolio 

## App Introduction:

The application that we propose to develop is a simple stock trading mobile app that allows users to be able to create an account, and once logged in, be able to browse various stock markets, indices, currencies and more. Also, we hope to be able to incorporate a stock portfolio, allowing the user to visualize and organize their holdings. 

The target audience for this app are:
Stock traders or financial analysts who like to view live market data.
Anyone interested in stocks and investing.
Newcomers looking to learn about financial investment.

The app aims to help users build their stock portfolio and organize their financial investments. The app also aims to give new users a simple interface to view various tickers and see their charts and data. 

Functionality that the app will be implementing will be to allow users to browse various tickers or search for specific tickers and be able to see their historical data, as well as live changing data (if applicable). The user will be allowed to add a ticker to their portfolio in which case they can receive background notifications if a certain price is met. All of this information will be saved in a firestore cloud database along with user account information which is used to login. 

For now we are going to try to implement these functionalities in our MVP as we know there will be plenty of challenges that we will face. 

** Functionality subject to change **


## Work Distribution

Since we are in the early stages of project development, and our group was very recently made, our job duties are still pretty vague as we analyze detailed requirements for our project. For now we have three main modules to assign to team members, these include: UI, backend/database, and API connection. 

Zahaak: Responsible for API calls and incorporating the backend through the business logic/ data model classes and database connection. 

Shareef: Responsible for UI related duties and creating Watch app. Including changes in User experience, navigation through the app, and visually appealing views. 

** Roles and duties subject to change **
